# Capstone_Project_Adv_Data_analytics

The Employee Attrition Prediction Project focuses on leveraging data analytics and machine learning techniques to predict whether an employee will stay or leave the company based on various work-related factors. This project applies industry-standard methodologies to analyze real-world datasets, ensuring practical applicability and valuable insights for workforce management.

### Objectives

Conduct in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and relationships within the dataset.

Apply data preprocessing techniques, including handling missing values, feature engineering, and scaling.

Implement machine learning models to predict employee attrition and assess model performance.

Utilize visualization tools to present findings effectively.

Interpret results and provide actionable insights for employee retention strategies.

### Dataset

The dataset used for this project includes 11,991 employee records with 18 features.

Key features include satisfaction level, last evaluation, number of projects, average monthly hours, tenure, work accident history, promotion history, salary level, and department information.

The 'left' column is the target variable, where 1 indicates the employee has left the company and 0 indicates they have stayed.
